In this version we have done the list of steps.

1. We have created a function in database handler class to get the list of items inserted in database.
2. We have called the function of getting the list of items in the MainActivity.
3. And we have designed the the activity_main as we have added the textview for showing an hint when there is not item in the database and added a recyclerview.
